Unreal Divergence EA is an expert advisor designed to trade in the forex market. It has been developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and more information about the product can be found on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/). Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product, but we are showcasing sample code that works in a similar manner as described in this product.

## Functionality

The Unreal Divergence EA is an automated trading system that identifies potential exhaustion points in price action and opens positions accordingly. It allows for the customization of various input parameters such as the maximum number of positions to open, position size, stop loss, and take profit levels. The EA constantly monitors the market and opens new positions when the conditions are met.

## Code Description

The code is written in MQL5 language and consists of several functions:

1. The `OnInit` function is called during expert initialization and is used to initialize necessary components. It returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` if initialization is successful.
2. The `OnDeinit` function is called during expert deinitialization and is used to clean up and release resources.
3. The `OnTick` function is the main entry point for the expert and is called on every tick. It checks if the maximum number of positions has been reached, identifies potential exhaustion points, and opens new positions if the conditions are met.
4. The `OpenPosition` function is responsible for calculating the position size, stop loss, and take profit levels, and placing a buy/sell order with the calculated parameters. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the order was executed successfully.

The code also includes input parameters defined using the `input` keyword, allowing users to customize the EA's behavior according to their trading preferences.

1. Download the EA file from the official developer's website.
